#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering  includes the use of computer codes to design, develop, test, and maintain software systems. It allows for creating games, apps and websites that are used to solve real-life problems. It is important in the technology industry as it is the foundation of the tech world due to its abilitu to create high-quality software solutions that are fundamental for other industries such as healthcare, education, finance and other sectors.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Introduction to Structured Programming: It allowed for breakdown of programs into modular structures allowing for more easy readability and maintainability
Introduction of Object-Orientated Programming (OOP): It improved software enginnering as it allowed developrs to model real-world entities as objects which led to better code organisation and programming lanugages such as Java enhanced software reusability and scalability
Rise of Agile development : This allowed for shift from rigid, document dependent methodologies to flexible processes.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning- Defining scope, timelines and resources
2. Requirement Analysis- Understanding detailed user needs and functionalities
3. Design - Creating a system architecture and outlining how components will interact.
4. Implementation - It is coding therefore it includes writing and compiling the actual code
5. Testing- Done to identify and fix bugs to ensure software quality
6. Deployment - It is the releassing the completed software to users
7. Maintainance- It involves updating and fixing issues after release to maintain the quality of sofwrae 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies- They are linear and sequential methods with rules where each phase is first completed before moving to the next one. Real-life examples includes government systems
Agile Methodologiesprioritizes collaboration, continuous delivery and customer feedback. Agile breaks work into iterative steps, which are smaller tasks that can be completed quickly. example includes mobile app development.
 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer - writes codes for systems designed by them. Also fixes computer bugs
2. Quality Assurance Engineer- It ensures software quality by running different tests.
3. Project Manager- overseas project timelines, budgets, scope and team coordination.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 1. IDEs They provide tools for coding, debugging and testing .It is important as it helps programmers to code efficiently. Due to combining all the tools it increases the developers productivity. Examples include Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA
 2. VCS manages code modification and team collaboration. It keeps tracks of all changes to the code therefore allows to rectify mistakes that occur as the developers can compare to the previous version of the code to fix the mistake without disrupting everyone's work.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. The evolving of technologies as AI is playing a major role in the tech industry so keeping up with technoloy can be difficult. It can be overcame by continuous learning and exploring different tech conferences to explore upcoming techenologies.
2. Maintaing user data privacy is a growing concern globally. It can be mitigated by ensuring security protocols such data encryption
3. User chnaging requirements as it disrupts work load and timelines. Therefore by scheduling and  knowning deadlines and being efficient at work
4. Scalability issues as designing softawre that cnnaot handle increase user load can cause problems therefore consider future growth when designing the architecture of the software
5. Maintainance burden as an overload of maintainance includes fixing bugs which can take time away form new developments or new projects. It can be minimised by having regular code reviews to identify potential problems


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing- It tests individual components , and the written code. Done to ensure it's the correct instructions for the software.
2. Integration Testing- It checks interactions between modules also verifying how different parts of software intergrate. It is done to ensure that the components work easily when together.
3. System Testing: It tests if the software system works properly with other softwares and hardware sytem. This ensure that the software is effiencet before given to the user.
4. Acceptance testing: It is done prior to deployment and it done to ensure that the software meets the user expectations and the business requirements .


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering incudes use of AI tools to write a set of commands known as propmts. It is done to optimize interactions with AI models and is essential for obtaining accurate and relevant responses from AI system improving  their efficinecy in automation, researhc and content generation.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- Tell me about history 
Improves prompt - Tell me  a summary of South African history highlighting Apartheid from the year it started to whn it ended . 
It specifies the country minimising the history to focus on one country 
I mentioned Aartheid era therefore will focus on the main history of apartheid in SA
it defines scope as it limits the search to when it started to wehn it ended
